2. Protecting both donors and beneficiaries while exchanging menstrual supplies.

### Project introduction
블루밍은 소외계층 여성 청소년을 위한 지역 비대면 생리대 기부 플랫폼이다.

The Blooming Box is located in the women's restroom of a subway station for good accessibility, so that donors can donate or beneficiaries can take sanitary pads non-face-to-face.
There is a hole in the upper part of the box, so anyone can donate at any time, and in order to take a sanitary pad, you must sign up the Blooming site and get a password after being recognized as a beneficiary.
Donors and beneficiaries keep a record on the site when they donate or take sanitary pads.
Donors do not have to leave a record on the site, but if they leave a record, a certificate will be awarded based on the record that is left.
With Blooming non-face-to-face donations, Girls with poor economic conditions can ease their worries about their menstruation.
We hope Blooming blooms the life of low-income female teenagers and creates a virtuous circle of society by reducing inequality.
